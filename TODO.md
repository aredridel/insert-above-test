* Make scrolling always pause-free -- perhaps use velocity of scrolling to discover how much to display at a time
* Handle top and bottom states
* Add hooks to notify the display system when more arrives
* Check and see whether requestAnimationFrame is really the tool for the job, or whether we should push ourselves into scroll events
